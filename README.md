# the-endless-ponzi
A simple DApp that would Shock the Cryptoshere
A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam which generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors. This is similar to a pyramid scheme in that both are based on using new investors' funds to pay the earlier backers.
What if the ealier investors stopped earning at a point? What if there was a way to collect back from ealier investors for newer investors? what if there is algorithm to make it never crash? WILL IT STILL BE A PONZI?
I beleive i have the perfect idea and will privide the .SOL needed for the project, you write the code and get the benefits
i need two people who know 'Rust' and can write solana programs 
Then this project goes private and devnet!
